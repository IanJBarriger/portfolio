**MLB Linear Regression Modeling in R** 

[MLB Linear Regression Project](https://github.com/IanJBarriger/MLBLinearReggresion)

- This project used MLB statistics from the 2000 to 2015 seasons sourced from Baseball Reference. The individual season statistics were combined to create a complete data set.
- The data was applied to form a regression model predicting season win percentage using season-long statistics, such as hits, runs, home runs, ERA, and run differential.
