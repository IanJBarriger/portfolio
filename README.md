## Projects 
**Personal Spotify Data Analysis and Visualization** 

[Spotify Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/IanJBarriger/SpotifyDataAnalysis)

This project used a collection of my personal Spotify data dating from February 2021 to January 2025 to collect insight into artist and listening trends. The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and manipulation, while Tableau was used for interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.
